# Refactored Todo App: Explanation and Testing

## **Why Refactor?**

* **Readability:** Well-structured code is easier to understand and maintain.
* **Modularity:** Separating code into components makes it easier to modify and reuse individual parts.
* **Testability:** Modular code is simpler to test, leading to a more reliable application.

## **Changes Made:**

*   **Models:**  Defined a `Todo` model to represent todo items (using SQLAlchemy).
*   **Routes:**  Separated Flask routes into a `todo_routes.py` file.
*   **Services:**  Created a `todo_service.py` file to encapsulate todo list logic (adding, updating, deleting todos).
*   **Tests:**  Added `test_todo_routes.py` to test the application's core functionality.

## **Running Tests**

1. **Environment:** Ensure you have any necessary testing libraries (e.g., `unittest`) installed in your Python environment.
2. **Command:** From your project's root directory, execute the following in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m unittest
   ```

**Successful tests mean your refactoring likely hasn't broken the core functionality!**
