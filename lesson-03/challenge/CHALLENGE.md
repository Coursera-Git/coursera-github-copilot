# Refactoring & Testing a Todo App

## **Objective**

* Enhance the structure and organization of a small Flask-based todo application.
* Introduce tests to ensure the application's continued functionality.

## **The Task**

1. **Refactor:** Restructure the existing codebase. Aim to improve code readability, maintainability, and modularity. Separate concerns into logical components, such as models, routes, and services.
2. **Test:**  Write tests to safeguard the application's behavior before and after your code changes. Tests guarantee that your refactoring doesn't introduce unexpected bugs. 

## **Tools**

* **GitHub Copilot:**  Leverage Copilot for refactoring suggestions and help with generating test cases. Experiment with its capabilities.
* **Search Engines:** Feel free to search the web for guidance and best practices in Python refactoring and testing!

## **Starting Point**

You'll begin with a basic Flask todo application (main.py, templates, etc.). Your goal is to refactor it into the provided modular structure.

**Remember:** There's no single "right" way to refactor. The most important thing is making the code cleaner and easier to work with.
